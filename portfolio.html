    <h1 style="color: cyan;">   Project#1 T-Day Invasion of turt.</h1>
    The project was an interesting one because it took an entire week to develop. I really enjoyed working on it. The game is technicaly space invaders with a twist. You shoot turtle swith straws to kill them. The turtles scream when they die which is quite funny.

    The baby dropping sim was the most challenging project we have attempted so far the collision checkers would randomly fail to work but it was an over all pretty fun experience. sad baby says hi.

    <h1 style="color: cyan;">   Karrovskis last stand</h1>
    It was a fun game to make I worked heavily on the sprites and assets of the game. Im pretty happy on how it turned out but i wish we could have had more time to make it fully.
