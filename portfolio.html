          <h1 style="color: cyan;">   Project#1 T-Day Invasion of turt.</h1>
          The project was an interesting one because it took an entire week to develop. I really enjoyed working on it. The game is technicaly space invaders with a twist. You shoot turtle swith straws to kill them. The turtles scream when they die which is quite funny.

          The baby dropping sim was the most challenging project we have attempted so far the collision checkers would randomly fail to work but it was an over all pretty fun experience. sad baby says hi.

          It was a fun game to make I worked heavily on the sprites and assets of the game. Im pretty happy on how it turned out but i wish we could have had more time to make it fully.

          <h1 style="color: cyan;">   Use data files to create graphs.</h1>
          <br>
          This was a much more difficult project then I thought I felt that the data was difficult to use for the most part.

          This project was interesting and dit ake some time. I learned a lot about how simulations and how we can reap data from them. I enjoyed gathering data on this simulation.
